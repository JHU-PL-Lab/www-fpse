Assignment 5
------------

For this assignment we will refactor some stateful OCaml code to use a state monad.

* Answer the code and written questions in [this zip file](assignment5.zip) for your assignment.
* Like assignment 1-4, we are giving you a skeleton to fill in.  Your answers will go in the file  `assignment5/src/monads.ml`.  
* One question there requires a written answer, just put it in comments so your code still compiles.
* Note that we provide a template as before for tests, but we are not going to grade your tests or coverage as the code here is simple and it is primarily a conceptual assignment.


### Submission and Grading
* From directory `.../assignment5` do a `dune clean` and then run the command `zip -r submission.zip *` or similar to zip up all the files for submission.
