Assignment 4: Monads
--------------------

* Answer the code and written questions in [this zip file](assignment5.zip) for your assignment.  Download and unzip it in a fresh directory/folder that you made (we will suppose you are putting it in a directory `assignment5` in the below).  
* Like assignment 1-4, we are giving you a skeleton to fill in.  Your answers will go in the file  `.../assignment5/src/monads.ml`.
* You will also need to make a unit tester in `.../assignment5/tests/tests.ml` following the previous assignments.

### Submission and Grading
* From directory `.../assignment5` do a `dune clean` and then run the command `zip -r submission.zip *` or similar to zip up all the files for submission.
