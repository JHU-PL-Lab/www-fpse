## What is FP?

### History in brief

* Lambda calculus, 1930's - logicians (Church, Turing, Kleene, Curry, etc)
 - Logic proofs are formal constructions
 - Core ideas of functional programming already present
 - But no computers so no running, only hand-calculation
* Lisp, 1960's (McCarthy)
 - Implement the ideas of the mathematicians
 - Goal application space: artificial intelligence programming
 - Added list data to functions: **Lis**t **P**rocessing
* Typed functional languages, 70's & 80's: ML and its descendents Haskell and OCaml
 - Will see what this is in detail as we use OCaml
* Modern era: add FP as possibility in mainstream: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.
* FP now edging out OO school in some domains.

### Imperative vs OO vs FP

* Oversimplifying but these are the three modern schools
* More oversimplifying: "Imperative = C, OO = Java, FP = OCaml"
 - other languages can also be put in schools, but these are leading representatives today
