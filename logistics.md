## Logistics

### Lecture Schedule

Lectures will be 1:30-2:45 on Mondays and Wednesdays in Shaffer 303. The Zoom room for those unable to attend in person be posted on the Q&A board (see below for how to get on that).  Lectures will be recorded and the Panopto page for those recordings will also be posted.

### Syllabus

See the [Dateline](dateline.html) for the schedule and the topics that will be covered.

### Gradescope

[Gradescope](https://gradescope.com) will be used for assignment submission and grade posting. See the Q&A board for the entry code.

### Q&A board

We will be using a Q&A board for online discussions. You will need to register for The [FPSE Q&A board Page](TBA) (Not set up yet!) so you can receive course announcements and discuss the material with other students.

### Assignments

All assignments are linked from the [dateline](dateline.html). They will all be programming exersises, primarily in OCaml.

### Project

There will be a small independent project at the end of the course worth around three homeworks.

### Collaboration

The collaboration policy for assignments is you are encouraged to discuss assignments with other students, but everyone must submit their own writeup of the answers (no emailing solutions to each other for example).

Please make sure to consult the course [Academic Integrity Policy](integrity.html) on what is legitimate interaction for homeworks, it is spelled out in detail there.

#### Late HW Policy

You will be given the same number of "late days" as there are assignments. For each assigment you can use up to three of your late days quota, each one allowing you to submit the assignment one day later. **The quantum of lateness is the day, so if you are 15 seconds late that counts as a day late.** If you have a cold or flu you can use the late days for such absences; if you have an extended excused absence contact instructors on Q&A board and we can work something out.

### Office hours

Office hours will be pinned on the course Q&A board.
### Exams

There will be no exams.
