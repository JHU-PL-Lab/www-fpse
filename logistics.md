### Lecture Schedule

Lectures will be 1:30-2:45 on Mondays and Wednesdays in Shaffer 300. Lectures will be recorded and the Panopto page for those recordings will also be posted.

### Syllabus

See the [Dateline](dateline.html) for the schedule and the topics that will be covered.

### Gradescope

[Gradescope](https://gradescope.com) will be used for assignment submission and grade posting. See the Q&A board for the entry code.

### Courselore Q&A board

We will be using the [Courselore Q&A board](https://courselore.org/courses/0644001341) for online discussions. A registration link will be emailed so you can sign up, and it will also be posted on Canvas.  All information not on this website, such as locations of Panopto recordings, office hours, etc will be posted on Courselore.

### Assignments

All assignments are linked from the [dateline](dateline.html). They will all be programming exercises, primarily in OCaml.

### Project

There will be an independent team project at the end of the course worth around three homeworks.

### Collaboration

The collaboration policy for assignments is you are *encouraged* to discuss assignments with other students, but everyone **must submit their own writeup of the answers** (no emailing/DMing solutions to each other for example).  You are also required to list all collaborators on your submission.

Please make sure to consult the course [Academic Integrity Policy](integrity.html) on what is legitimate interaction for homeworks, it is spelled out in detail there.

#### Late HW Policy

You will be given the same number of "late days" as there are assignment submission deadlines (around 9 total based on the planned dateline; if Part I and Part II are on different due dates they each give one late day). For each deadline you can use up to three of your late days quota, each one allowing you to submit the assignment one day later.  **The quantum of lateness is the day, so if you are 15 seconds late that counts as a day late.** If you have a cold or flu you can use the late days for such absences; if you have an extended excused absence contact instructors on Courselore and we can work something out.

### Office hours

Office hours will be pinned on Courselore.
### Exams

There will be no exams.  The project demos will take place around what would have been the final exam slot for the course.
