## Primary Resources

* [Real World OCaml 2nd Edition](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/toc.html)
* [Cornell book](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2020sp/textbook/)
* [Awesome OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-community/awesome-ocaml)

Smaller things
* [OCaml Best practices](https://engineering.issuu.com/2018/11/20/our-current-ocaml-best-practices-part-1)
* [Imperative to functional refactoring JavaScript example](https://medium.com/software-craftsman/functional-refactoring-in-javascript-c0fe718f4efb); [another](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/functional-javascript-learn-by-refactoring/)
* [Try OCaml](https://try.ocamlpro.com) - for early on before people get opam installed.

#### Example programs to study

* [99 problems](https://github.com/MassD/99) - a bunch of short OCaml coding examples.
* [Exercism](https://github.com/exercism/ocaml/tree/master/exercises) - more examples, more broad than the 99 problems ones. [All answers here](https://exercism.io/tracks/ocaml/exercises)

## Course Planning Ideas

* Code critique: get several dozen excellent examples and base feature discussions around them.  Code mentoring in general is a key to learning good programming principles.  Cornell course not so good on this point..
   - Use exercism for shorter examples of this.  Pick 3-4 of their problems and find several solutions some good some bad.  Can do this early in course.
   
* Project focus ideas: porting existing tools to OCaml.  JSON, whatever.. think of libraries popular for OOSE projects for example.

* Opam jam - we all get together to install it.

* Give remote exam but ask them to sign a pledge.  Make it open book but in a window reasonably large.

* Use break-out rooms for code reviews.
