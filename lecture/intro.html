<h2 id="course-outline">Course Outline</h2>

<p>See the <a href="../dateline.html">Dateline</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-functional-programming-fp">What is Functional Programming (FP)?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It is a style of programming where functions are the centerpiece</li>
  <li>A key dimension is functions-as-data aka higher-order functions: functions can be passed to and returned from functions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lack-of-side-effects">Lack of Side Effects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>FP emphasizes <em>immutability</em>: data structures that cannot be changed after being created</li>
  <li>More generally than limited mutation, most functions only return data, they have no other behaviors on the side (no “side effects”)
    <ul>
      <li>No printing, I/O, mutating, raising exceptions, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lack of side effects is called “referential transparency” - variable values don’t change out from under you (follows how math behaves).</li>
  <li>Functional data structures are analogues of imperative ones: dictionaries, lists, etc, but <em>immutable</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of mutating, make a fresh copy.</li>
      <li>Sounds like it will be extremely inefficient but it is reasonable in “most” cases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="history-in-brief">History in brief</h3>

<ul>
  <li>λ-calculus, 1930’s - developed by logicians (Church, Turing, Kleene, Curry, etc)
    <ul>
      <li>Logic proofs are formal constructions, expressed as programs in the λ-calculus</li>
      <li>The 1930’s λ-calculus is the core of a modern functional programming language</li>
      <li>Note all of this was before computers even existed - !!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lisp, late 1950’s (McCarthy)
    <ul>
      <li>λ-calculus is elegant, so build a PL around it</li>
      <li>Goal application space: artificial intelligence programming</li>
      <li>Added list data to λ functions: <strong>Lis</strong>t <strong>P</strong>rocessing</li>
      <li>Lisp is the ancestor of all modern dynamically-typed languages: Python, JavaScript, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Typed functional languages, 70’s &amp; 80’s: Milner’s ML and its descendents Haskell and OCaml
    <ul>
      <li>We will be using OCaml</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Modern era: add FP as possibility in mainstream PLs: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="imperative-vs-object-oriented-vs-higher-order-functional">Imperative vs Object-Oriented vs Higher-Order Functional</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Oversimplifying but these are the three modern schools</li>
  <li>More oversimplifying: “Imperative = C, OO = Java, FP = OCaml”</li>
  <li>Note many O-O languages now have functions, often called lambdas for the historical reference</li>
  <li>Goal of this course is to get deeply into the FP mode of programming, which can then be used in your favorite PL - Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, OCaml, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="imperative">Imperative</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Imperative also has functions, but there functions often have side effects (e.g. mutate some shared data structures)</li>
  <li>C has function pointers to pass around functions as data but they are not widely used and lack needed expressiveness (a topic we will cover later).</li>
  <li>Need to explicitly manage memory with <code>malloc/free</code> and pointers which leads to many errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="object-oriented-oo">Object-Oriented (OO)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Objects tend to have “their” state encapsulated within their boundary</li>
  <li>It is usually mutable state - changes over time</li>
  <li>A function is like an object with one method, <code>call</code>, and with no fields
    <ul>
      <li>But, that analogy doesn’t fully capture higher-order functions which is why <code>lambda</code> added to Java.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="functional-fp">Functional (FP)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Advantages described above: declarative nature and correctness, more composable</li>
  <li>Sometimes less good at supporting extension: e.g. no notion of subclass in functional paradigm</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="which-one-wins">Which one wins?</h3>
<p>Thesis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Imperative often wins for low-level code: underlying machine instructions are in the imperative domain, will run faster.</li>
  <li>O-O often wins for very large apps with shallow logic: UI’s, etc.</li>
  <li>Functional often wins for complex algorithms with deep inner logic, and also for data manipulation focus
    <ul>
      <li>Gets too confusing with mutation, and better composition of functions makes code easier to understand.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="typed-functional-vs-untyped-functional">Typed Functional vs Untyped Functional</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There are typed FP languages (OCaml, Haskell, TypeScript, etc) and uptyped ones (Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Python, JavaScript, etc)</li>
  <li>We are clearly in the types camp here with OCaml but there are trade offs
    <ul>
      <li>With types we have <em>type-directed programming</em>: types serve as a skeleton of the code structure, and often once all the type errors are fixed the code .. works!</li>
      <li>The downside is types can get in the way both in terms of code maintenance and in terms of expressiveness.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
