    <h1 id="the-functional-programming-language-universe">The Functional Programming Language Universe</h1>

<ul>
  <li>“This is the Dawn of the Age of FP”, there are now many choices of languages</li>
  <li>There are both many viable Functional-focused languages as well as FP extensions to existing languages.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="functional-focused-languages">Functional-focused languages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>These are languages designed with FP style in mind from the start: immutable variables and data structures, full higher-order functions, currying, etc.</li>
  <li>There are generally two “schools”
    <ul>
      <li>ML school: static types, type inference, polymorphism, pattern matching (OCaml, Standard ML, Haskell, F#, etc)</li>
      <li>Lisp school: dynamically typed (Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, etc)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ocaml">OCaml</h3>

<p>Of course we have to mention OCaml!</p>

<h3 id="haskell">Haskell</h3>

<p>Haskell is in the ML school; Devin will present Haskell in detail.</p>

<h3 id="f">F#</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fsharp.org">F#</a> is Microsoft’s ML-style language, it has all the main features of OCaml</li>
  <li>It integrates well with the MSFT toolchain</li>
  <li>Here is an example from their tutorial; looks familiar, eh?<br />
```f#<br />
let square x = x * x<br />
let isOdd x = x % 2 &lt;&gt; 0</li>
</ul>

<p>let sumOfOddSquares nums =<br />
    nums<br />
    |&gt; List.filter isOdd<br />
    |&gt; List.sumBy square</p>

<p>let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]<br />
let sum = sumOfOddSquares numbers<br />
printfn “The sum of the odd squares in %A is %d” numbers sum</p>

<p>type Shape =<br />
    | Square of side: double<br />
    | Rectangle of width: double * length: double</p>

<p>let getArea shape =<br />
    match shape with<br />
    | Square side -&gt; side * side<br />
    | Rectangle (width, length) -&gt; width * length</p>

<p>let square = Square 2.0<br />
printfn “The area of the square is %f” (getArea square)</p>

### Reason

* [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io) is an interesting beast, it has **exactly** the features of OCaml
  - but with a somewhat different syntax not so loaded with historical oddities and kludges
  - You can convert `.rs` to `.ml` and vice-versa very cleanly and it also translates to JavaScript for browser code
  - The [Overview](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/overview) provides a glimpse of the syntax
    - it is not hard to see how it is a minor variation on OCaml
  - We will play with [this live demo](https://reasonml.github.io/en/try) which shows code in all three languages at once

#### ReasonReact

* The main thrust behind Reason is use of FP in web UI programming
* ReasonReact is the Reason version of Facebook's excellent React UI library
* We will take a peek at a [Simple To Do app](https://github.com/reasonml-old/reason-react-example/tree/master/src/todomvc) written in ReasonReact

### Elm

* [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) is an ML-school language 
* Designed for writing web apps, it runs in the browser via translation to JS.
   - Similar to Reason in goal

### Scala

* Scala is a hybrid of Java and ML which runs on the JVM so can link with Java libraries
* It is easier to do FP in compared to Java since it was built-in from the start: pattern matching, type inference, etc.

### Lisp / Scheme / Racket

* Lisp was the very first functional programming language, from the late 50's
  - it was dynamically typed, there are no type declarations or inference and errors caught at runtime.
* Scheme was a clean-up of Lisp in the 70's-80's, there were several errors in the Lisp design
  - e.g. dynamic scoping -- closures were not computed in Lisp.
* [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) is a popular modern dialect of Scheme with many added features including types
* Additionally, Smalltalk, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript are dynamically-typed and are thus descended from Lisp.

### Clojure

Clojure is in the Lisp school; Kelvin will present Clojure in detail.


## FP Extensions to YourFavoriteLang

* It is now possible to do FP-style programming in Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc.
* All of these languages now fully support higher-order functions with Currying, etc.
* But, there is not necessarily good library support or integration
* Also, to "really do" FP you need immutable data structures and variables
  - limited support for that in most of these languages currently

### FP in Java

Java 8+ has **Lambdas**

*   Lambdas are a bit clunky to use compared to OCaml due to how they were patched in.
*   Java 8 higher-order functions  "pun" as an interface with only one method in it.  
    - the function is taken to be the body of that single method, no need to write the method name when declaring the function then.
*   There is also some (limited) type inference for Lambda parameters.
*   [Here is a tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html)
*   Currying in Java, somewhat painfully: [Gist currying example](https://gist.github.com/timyates/7674005). For that example here is the [Function](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Function.html) and [BiFunction](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/BiFunction.html) type.
* Use `final` to declare variables immutable in Java - use it!

Terminology aside: _closure_

*   A _closure_ is just a higher-order function return value
*   The term "closure" comes from how they are implemented -- all variables not local to the function must be remembered
*   OCaml example:

```ocaml
# let f = (fun x -&gt; fun y -&gt; x + y) 4;;
val f : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt; (* f is at runtime the closure &lt;fun y code, {x |-&gt; 4}&gt; *)
# f 3;;
- : int = 7   &lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Note how `x` is a function parameter and is remembered in spite of function returning, means `x` needs to be _copied_ into the closure.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="fp-in-c">FP in C++</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone is joining the Lambda party!</li>
  <li>Details <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function#C.2B.2B_.28since_C.2B.2B11.29">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Closures are a headache in C++ due to different low-level ways data can be accessed in C++.</li>
  <li>Use <code>const</code> declarations to get immutable variables</li>
  <li>C++ also has some type inference a la OCaml  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Type_inference">C++ local type inference </a>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. <code>auto mydata = 22;</code>. <code>auto</code> is like <code>var</code> in Java.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>C++-14 adds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++14#Generic_lambdas">generic lambdas</a> which look like the polymorphic types of OCaml/Java but are really just fancy macros.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fp-in-python">FP In Python</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Python “already has” FP including closures and Currying.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-python">def adder(x):
     def uni_adder(y):
         return x + y
     return uni_adder
 
print adder(4)(18)
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li>The above is a bit clunky having to name the intermediate function</li>
  <li><code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>reduce</code> etc are already in the core language</li>
  <li>In addition, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html"><code>functools</code></a> standard library supports other convenience higher-order function operations</li>
  <li>Plus, if you want even more FP-ism, there are additional libraries such as <a href="https://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">PyToolz</a><br />
```python<br />
from toolz import curry<br />
@curry<br />
 def add(x, y):<br />
   return x + y</li>
</ul>

<p>plusfour = add(4)</p>
<pre><code>
* PyToolz is basically a port of the Clojure FP libraries to Python
* Python is weak on immutable variables, there is no `const`/`final`
    - but the tuples and `frozenset` are immutable data structures
    - and Python 3.8 now has `final`


### FP In JavaScript

* JavaScript is similar to Python, it has the basics built-in already
```javascript
function adder(a) 
{ return function uni_adder(b) 
    { return a+b;
    };
};
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li><code>const</code> declarations bring the FP immutable variable default to JS - use it!</li>
  <li>JavaScript has no immutable data structures however
    <ul>
      <li>means e.g. lists won’t be able to share sub-structures so “FP programming” will be less efficient in JS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
